# E-Commerce Store Backend
This is the documentation for the E-Commerce Store backend, which is built using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize. This backend provides the necessary APIs and functionality to support the operations of an E-Commerce Store.

## Features
The E-Commerce Store backend offers the following features:

* User Authentication: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
* Product Management: Provides APIs to create, read, update, and delete products.
* Order Management: Allows users to place orders and manage their orders.
* Category Management: Provides APIs to create, read, update, and delete product categories.
* Payment Integration: Integrates with a payment gateway to process payments for orders.
* User Authorization: Implements role-based access control to restrict access to certain APIs based on user roles.

## Technology Stack
The E-Commerce Store backend is built using the following technologies:

* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
* Express: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* Sequelize: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with the database.
* MySQL: The chosen database management system for storing data.
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for user authentication and authorization.
* JOI: Used for Schema Validation.
* bcrypt: Used for password Hashing.
* multer: Used for uploading files/images to the project.
* AWS S3: Used for uploading files/images to cloud.
* NodeMailer: Used for sending mails.
* Stripe: Used for payment integration.

## Project Structure
The project structure of the E-Commerce Store backend follows a modular approach:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ config/         # Configuration files (database, authentication, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ controller/     # Request handlers for each route
â”œâ”€â”€ database/       # Database models
    â””â”€â”€ models
â”œâ”€â”€ dbSeed/         # Pre-functions for initial process
â”œâ”€â”€ middlewares/    # Custom middleware functions
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/         # API routes
â”œâ”€â”€ services/       # Business logic and data manipulation
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions and helpers
    â””â”€â”€ helper
â”œâ”€â”€ validation/     # Validation Objects for Requested Data
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js       # Entry point of the application
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json    # Project dependencies and scripts
```

## Installation
To set up and run the E-Commerce Store backend on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tayyab-cs/E-Commerce-Store.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `npm i`.
4. Set up the database by configuring the database connection in `config/config.js`.
5. Create `.env` file and set the Environment Variables.
6. Start the server: `npm start`.

## API Documentation
The API documentation for the E-Commerce Store backend can be found in the [API Documentation](https://api.postman.com/collections/12306298-5b3a4aba-29b4-4181-87f7-992c68aa0867?access_key=PMAT-01H25WVSGYJ1BBNS9QKWBMDVWP) file.

## Conclusion
The E-Commerce Store backend provides a robust foundation for building an E-Commerce application. It leverages Node.js, Express, and Sequelize to offer essential features like user authentication, product and order management, cart functionality, and more.
